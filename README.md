> Rebuilding the JS8Call protocol core in Rust — Make open source transmissible — over the air, across the world.

---

## 🌐 What is `js8core-rs`?

`js8core-rs` is a Rust reimplementation of the **JS8Call protocol**, designed for weak-signal, low-power, and off-grid communication over HF (shortwave) radio.  
It focuses on environments where bandwidth is scarce, latency is high, and infrastructure is nonexistent — such as:

- Emergency communications after disasters  
- Off-grid expeditions and field kits  
- Embedded devices in harsh environments  
- Simulated interplanetary networks (e.g., MarsNet)

---

## 📦 Project Origin

This project is a cleanroom reimplementation of the original [JS8Call C++ codebase](https://bitbucket.org/widefido/js8call/src/js8call/) maintained by KN4CRD.  
That legacy implementation is:

- Built with Qt GUI bindings  
- Intertwined with desktop components  
- Challenging to modularize or embed

Our goal is to **extract and modernize the protocol core** into a standalone, testable, embeddable Rust library — fully open-source and suitable for headless operation.

---

## 🧭 Why Rust?

Rust provides:

- ✅ Memory safety with zero-cost abstractions  
- ✅ `no_std` support for embedded and bare-metal  
- ✅ Strong type system for protocol correctness  
- ✅ First-class async + concurrency tooling  
- ✅ Cross-compilation to WASM, CLI, Linux, and RTOS

With `js8core-rs`, we aim to produce a library that can run:

- In a browser tab  
- On a microcontroller  
- Inside a planetary rover  
- Or inside your terminal

---

## 🛰️ Use Case: MarsNet

**MarsNet** is a conceptual example of how this protocol could be deployed in the future:

- JS8-like messaging across isolated relay nodes  
- TTL-aware frames, timestamped packets, store-and-forward logic  
- Operable in solar-powered, delay-tolerant, disconnected mesh environments

Whether on Earth or elsewhere, `js8core-rs` supports signal-based messaging even when nothing else works.

## 🧱 Module Structure

js8core-rs ├── audio # I/O abstraction (WAV/PCM) ├── modem # Frame sync, symbol demod, SNR estimation ├── protocol # JS8 message logic and framing ├── codec # Huffman codec for compression ├── relay # Store-and-forward with TTL logic └── examples # CLI usage, test vectors, integration


Each module is self-contained and exposed as a Rust crate. Future support includes:

- WebAssembly bindings  
- `no_std` compatibility  
- CLI tooling + relay daemon (`js8d`)

## 📊 Protocol Layer Role

| Layer             | Purpose                                |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Application       | CLI, web frontend, headless services   |
| Protocol          | Framing, routing, relay logic          |
| Modem             | Baseband symbol-level decoding         |
| Audio             | Platform I/O bridge                    |
| Relay Engine      | Offline store/forward messaging        |
